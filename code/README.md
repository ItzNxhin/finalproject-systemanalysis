# LLM Prediction Pipeline

This directory contains all the components needed to run an LLM-based prediction pipeline. The script processes input data from `necessaryData` and generates a `submission.csv` file with the model’s predictions.

## Directory Structure

```
├── necessaryData/       # Folder containing all required input data files
├── llm.py               # Main script implementing the LLM inference pipeline
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies for the project
└── submission.csv       # Output CSV file generated by llm.py
```

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1. Download the data at `necessaryData` folder that contains all required input files.

2. Run the LLM inference script.

3. After execution, inspect `submission.csv` for the model’s output.

## Output

* **submission.csv**: CSV file containing the LLM model’s predictions, ready for submission or further analysis.
